# EcoSpy – Smart Waste Management System ♻️

EcoSpy is a smart waste management system designed to promote sustainable waste disposal through **real-time waste detection, segregation, and user incentives**. Our goal is to make communities cleaner while rewarding users for responsible waste management.

## 🚀 Project Overview
- Daily **doorstep waste pickup**.  
- Segregation into **Recyclable, Non-Recyclable, and Wet Waste**.  
- **Image recognition model (YOLOv8 + OpenCV)** classifies recyclable items.  
- Users earn **EcoPoints** for recyclables (1 point = ₹0.5).  
- **Bulk Orders:** >15kg recyclable waste → flexible pickup option.  
- **Dashboard:** Real-time tracking of collected waste & points earned.  
- **Future Scope:** Smart segregation machine on vehicles + weighing system.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Programming Languages:**  
- Python → Image recognition, detection model, Tkinter UI for admin  
- JavaScript (React) → Frontend website & dashboard  

**Frameworks & Libraries:**  
- React + Vite → Frontend
